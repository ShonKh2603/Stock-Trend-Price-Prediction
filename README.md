The purpose of this project is to predict whether the continuation of the stock price trend is an increase or a decrease.
First section of the project was data scraping from the web. I used Selenium and Beautiful Soup in order to gain the data that was needed for the project.
After crawling the data I had a lot of unuseful data and had to deal with them.
Visualizing the data helped me to understand my data and to check the corelations between all the features while using different plots for understanding the data.
End of the project was the prediction of my research. I used the SKlearn library and used 2 different models: KNN and Decision Tree. The result of the project was fantastic and got 76 percent of precision.
